Resume Reviewer is an AI-powered web application designed to provide personalized feedback on your resume based on specific job descriptions. This project leverages a Python backend built with FastAPI to handle file processing and AI interactions, paired with a React frontend for a smooth and intuitive user experience.

The backend utilizes Azure Form Recognizer to extract structured information from resumes and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to generate insightful feedback. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, delivering a fast and responsive interface, while the backend API is hosted on Render for reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure.

Together, these technologies create a seamless and intelligent resume review platform to help job seekers optimize their applications.
